# Frendo Chatbot

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! This is a simple implementation of a chatbot in JavaScript.

## Description

This chatbot is in its early stages and is designed to handle simple conversations. For example, you can interact with it by saying "hola" or asking "who is Frendo?"

## Usage

To keep the conversation simple, try commands like:
- `hola`
- `who are you`
##refrence for questions
check for the js codes array of bot res

## Future Work

I plan to enhance the chatbot's capabilities and improve its responses over time. and perhaps make it artificially intelligent using Rasa

## Live Demo

You can try out the chatbot live at [this link](https://dalliso-banda.github.io/frendoChatbot/).
